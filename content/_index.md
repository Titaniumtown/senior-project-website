## Goal and Motivation:
Create a tool that helps students in early Java courses understand concepts of classes and objects to bridge the gap between abstract concepts and concrete understanding by animating the process of object instantiation, reference assignment, and results of method invocation in a step-by-step way utilizing memory diagrams.

## Approach:
1. Object Creation Visualization
2. Method Invocation and State Changes
3. Step-by-Step Execution
4. Assess User-Drawn Diagrams

## Algorithms and tools:
- Parsing Java Code:
- Visualization Engine:
- Execution Simulation (step-by-step)
